# Patients Registry App

This is a Single Page Application built with React that communicates with a JSON server to keep track of patients and their previous and next appointment dates. This is useful to self employed psychologists, coaches, trainers and anybody that wants to keep track of their patients/clients for scheduling purposes.

## Requirements

This SPA uses a JSON server to fetch the data and you can set this up before running your App.

- Fork and clone this template repo: https://github.com/raffinol/json-server-template.

- Then, in a terminal window navigate to the repo local folder and install the dependencies by running:

  `npm install`

- Run the server:

  `npm start`

While your server is running, you can make requests to http://localhost:3000/patients. You can check it out in the browser to make sure your server works.

## Installation

- Fork and clone this repo. Then, in a terminal window navigate to the repo local folder and install the dependencies by running:

  `npm install`

- Start the app by running:

  `npm start`

This will start the app and automatically open it in your default browser, if the app doesn't automatically start you can go to http://localhost:4000 on your browser.

- **Enjoy!**

## How it works

You can click on any patient from the patient list to show their information. Once a patient is selected you can modify their information or delete it by clicking the respective buttons. You can also add new Patients clicking 'New Patient" at the navigation bar.
